# Lambdaspire - Swift Notifications

Strongly-typed User Notifications for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Action Identifier Strings (`actionIdentifier`) and User Info Dictionaries (`userInfo`) are replaced with `Codable` structs.

Built for internal use @Lambdaspire, so might not be fit for your purposes, but do as you wish with this package and/or the code.
